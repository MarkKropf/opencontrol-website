# OpenControl: What is it?

## It's a powerfully simply idea.

To improve the quality of our software development, we use continuous integration.
To improve the reliability of our deployment, we use continuous delivery.
To improve the security of our systems, we can use continuous authorization.

Simply put, the tools that we use to develop and operate software, should also be
used to generate and validate assessment and authorization packages.

Every commit runs the tests.
Every passing build, updates the system security plan.
Every deployment includes updates to continuous monitoring.

> Software as Code.

> Tests as Code.

> Infrastructure as Code.

> Compliance as Code.

## It's a schema.

By adopting a standard approach to documenting "controls" (whether Technical, Operational, or Management) we can rapidly build a community of vendors and operators

## It's a set of tools and best practices.

Right now we're excited about:
* [Concourse.ci](http://concourse.ci) (see an example at https://dragon.somegood.org)
* GitBook (see how the 18F have used this to produce the [System Security Plan for Cloud.Gov](https://masonry-gitbook.cloud.gov/index.html))


## It's a community.

Want to join? Simply [submit a pull request](https://github.com/opencontrol/opencontrol.github.io/compare) to this document and add yourself.

The Vendors and Operators below have, unofficially and without any legally-binding commitment, endorsed the principles of Continuous Authorization, and have agreed to
collaborate on the development of the OpenControl schema, tools and best practices.
